heart   not  the\\nbrain   was  considered  to  be  the  seat  of  the  soul  and  the  repository  of\\nmemories  indeed  while the rest of the body was carefully preserved for\\nthe afterlife  the brain of the deceased was simply scooped out through\\nthe  nostrils  and  discarded   the  view  that  the  heart  was  the  seat  of  con\\nsciousness  and  thought  was  not  seriously  challenged

about the brain from these\\nobservations \\nif your answer is that the brain is the organ of sensation  then you have\\nreached the same conclusion as several greek scholars of the fourth cen\\ntury b c  the most influential scholar was hippocrates  460 379 b c    the\\nfather of western medicine  who stated his belief that the brain not only\\nwas involved in sensation but also was the seat of intelligence \\nhowever   this  view  was  not  universally  accepted   the  famous  greek\\nphilosopher aristotle  384 322 b c   clung to the belief that the heart was\\nthe center of intellect  what function did aristotle reserve for the brain  he\\nproposed it to be a radiator for the cooling of blood that was overheated by\\nthe seething heart  the rational temperament of humans was thus

from the brain \\nhowever  as we shall see in part iii  modern neuroscience research sup\\nports  another  conclusion   the  mind  has  a  physical  basis   which  is  the\\nbrain \\nfortunately  other scientists during the seventeenth and eighteenth cen\\nturies broke away from galen s tradition of focusing on the ventricles and\\nbegan to give the substance of the brain a closer look  one of

key insights gained during the nineteenth century \\nnerves as wires  in 1751  benjamin franklin published a pamphlet titled\\nexperiments  and  observations  on  electricity   which  heralded  a  new  under\\nstanding of electrical phenomena  by the turn of the century  italian scien\\ntist luigi galvani and german biologist emil du boisreymond had shown\\nthat muscles can be caused to twitch when nerves are stimulated electri\\ncally and that the brain itself can generate electricity  these discoveries\\nfinally displaced the notion that nerves communicate with the brain by the\\nmovement of fluid  the new concept was that the nerves are  wires  that\\nconduct electrical signals to and from the brain \\nunresolved was whether the signals to the muscles causing movement\\nuse the same wires as those that register sensations from the skin  bidirec\\ntional communication along the same wires was suggested by the observa\\ntion that when a nerve in the body is cut  there is usually a loss of both\\nsensation and movement in the affected region  however  it was also known\\nthat within each nerve of the body there are many thin filaments  or nerve\\nfibers  each one of which could serve as an individual wire carrying infor\\nmation in a different direction \\nthis question was answered around 1810 by scottish physician charles\\nbell and french physiologist françois magendie  a curious anatomical fact\\nis that just before the nerves attach to the spinal cord  the fibers divide into\\ntwo branches  or roots  the dorsal root enters toward the back of the spinal\\ncord  and the ventral root enters toward the front  figure 1 9   bell tested\\nthe  possibility  that  these  two  spinal  roots  carry  information  in  different\\ndirections by cutting each root separately and observing the consequences\\nin  experimental  animals   he  found  that  cutting  only  the  ventral  roots\\ncaused muscle paralysis  later  magendie was able to show that the dorsal\\nroots  carry  sensory  information  into  the  spinal  cord   bell  and  magendie\\n   the origins of neuroscience         9\\nspinal \\ncord\\ndorsal\\nroots\\nventral roots\\nnerve      muscle

nerves attach to\\nthe spinal cord  bell and magendie found that\\nthe ventral roots contain only motor fibers\\nand the dorsal roots contain only sensory\\nfibers \\nconcluded that within each nerve there is a mixture of many wires  some\\nof which bring information into the brain and spinal cord and others that\\nsend  information  out  to  the  muscles   in  each  sensory  and  motor  nerve\\nfiber  transmission is strictly oneway  the two kinds of fibers are bundled\\ntogether  for  most  of  their  length   but  they  are  anatomically  segregated\\nwhen they enter or exit the spinal cord \\nlocalization of specific functions to different parts of the brain  if\\ndifferent functions are localized in different spinal roots  then perhaps dif\\nferent functions are also localized in different parts of the brain  in 1811 \\nbell proposed that the origin of the motor fibers is the cerebellum and the\\ndestination of the sensory fibers is the cerebrum \\nhow would you test this proposal  one way is to use the same approach\\nthat  bell  and  magendie  employed  to  identify  the  functions  of  the  spinal\\nroots   to  destroy  these  parts  of  the  brain  and  test  for  sensory  and  motor\\ndeficits  this approach  in which parts of the brain are systematically de\\nstroyed to determine their function  is called the experimental ablation method \\nin 1823  the esteemed french physiologist marie jean pierre flourens used\\nthis  method  in  a  variety  of  animals   particularly  birds   to  show  that  the\\ncerebellum does indeed play a role in the coordination of movement  he\\nalso concluded that the cerebrum is involved in sensation and perception \\nas bell and galen before him had suggested  unlike his predecessors  how\\never  flourens provided solid experimental support for his conclusions \\nwhat about all those bumps on the brain s surface  do they perform dif\\nferent functions as well  the idea that they do was irresistible to a young\\naustrian medical student named franz joseph gall  believing that bumps\\non the surface of the skull reflect the bumps on the surface of the brain  gall\\nproposed in 1809 that the propensity for certain personality traits  such as\\ngenerosity   secretiveness   and  destructiveness   could  be  related  to  the  di\\nmensions of the head  figure 1 10   to support his claim  gall and his fol\\nlowers  collected  and  carefully  measured  the  skulls  of  hundreds  of  people\\nrepresenting the extensive range of personality types  from the very gifted\\nto the criminally insane  this new  science  of correlating the structure of\\nthe head with personality traits was called phrenology  although the claims\\nof the phrenologists were never taken seriously by the mainstream scientific\\ncommunity  they did capture the popular imagination of the time  in fact  a\\ntextbook on phrenology published in 1827 sold over 100 000 copies  \\none of the most vociferous critics of phrenology was flourens  the same\\nman  who  had  shown  experimentally  that  the  cerebellum  and  cerebrum\\nperform different functions  his grounds for criticism were sound  for one\\nthing  the shape of the skull is not correlated with the shape of the brain \\nin addition  flourens performed experimental ablations showing that par\\nticular traits are not isolated to the portions of the cerebrum specified by\\nphrenology  flourens also maintained  however  that all regions of the cere\\nbrum  participate  equally  in  all  cerebral  functions   a  conclusion  that  later\\nwas shown to be erroneous \\nthe  person  usually  credited  with  tilting  the  scales  of  scientific  opinion\\nfirmly toward localization of function in the cerebrum was french neurol\\nogist  paul  broca   figure  1 11    broca  was  presented  with  a  patient  who\\ncould understand language but could not speak  following the man s death\\nin 1861  broca carefully

 functional  divisions  of  the\\ncerebrum rival even the most elaborate of those produced by the phrenol\\nogists  the big difference is that unlike the phrenologists  scientists today\\nrequire solid experimental evidence before attributing a specific function\\nto a portion of the brain  all the same  gall seems to have had the right\\nidea  it is natural to wonder why flourens  the pioneer of brain localiza\\ntion  of  function   was  misled  into  believing  that  the  cerebrum  acted  as  a\\nwhole  and  could  not  be  subdivided   there  are  many  reasons  that  this\\ngifted experimentalist may have missed cerebral localization  but it seems\\nclear that one reason was his visceral disdain for gall and phrenology  he\\ncould not bring himself to agree even remotely with gall  whom he viewed\\nas a lunatic  this reminds us that science  for better or worse  was and still\\nis a distinctly human endeavor  \\nthe evolution of nervous systems  in 1859  english biologist charles\\ndarwin   figure  1 13   published  on  the  origin  of  species   in  this  landmark\\nwork  he articulated a theory of evolution  that species of organisms evolved\\nfrom  a  common  ancestor   according  to  his  theory   differences  among\\nspecies arise by a process darwin called natural selection  as a result of the\\nmechanisms of reproduction  the physical traits of the offspring are some\\ntimes different from those of the parents  if these traits represent an advan\\ntage for survival  the offspring themselves will be more likely to reproduce \\nthus increasing the likelihood that the advantageous traits are passed on to\\nthe next generation  over the course of many generations  this process has\\nled to the development of traits that distinguish species today  flippers on\\nharbor seals  paws on dogs  hands on raccoons  and so on  this single insight\\nrevolutionized biology  today  scientific evidence ranging from anthropology\\nto molecular genetics overwhelmingly supports the theory of evolution by\\nnatural selection  \\ndarwin included behavior among the heritable traits that could evolve \\nfor example  he noticed that many mammalian species show the same re\\naction when frightened  the pupils of the eyes get bigger  the heart races \\nhairs stand on end  this is as true for a human as it is for a dog  to dar\\nwin  the similarities of this response pattern indicated that these different\\nspecies  evolved  from  a  common  ancestor   which  possessed  the  same  be\\nhavioral trait  advantageous presumably because it facilitated escape from\\npredators   because behavior reflects the activity of the nervous system  we\\ncan infer that the brain mechanisms that underlie this fear reaction may be\\nsimilar  if not identical  across these species \\nthe idea that the nervous systems of different species evolved from com\\nmon ancestors and may have common mechanisms is the rationale for relat\\ning the results of animal experiments to humans  thus  for example  many of\\nthe details of electrical impulse conduction along nerve fibers were worked\\nout first in the squid but are now known to apply equally well to humans \\nmost neuroscientists today use animal models to examine the process they wish\\nto understand in humans  for example  rats show clear signs of addiction if\\nthey are given the chance to

as\\nsuch  interpretations do not always withstand the test of time  for exam\\nple  at the time he made his observations  flourens was unaware that the\\ncerebrum of a bird is fundamentally different from that of a mammal  thus \\nhe wrongly concluded from experimental ablations in birds that there was\\nno localization of certain functions in the cerebrum of mammals  moreover \\nas mentioned before  his profound distaste for gall surely also colored his\\ninterpretation   the  point  is  that  the  correct  interpretation  often  remains\\nunrecognized until long after the original observations were made  indeed \\nmajor  breakthroughs  are  sometimes  made  when  old  observations  are\\nreinterpreted in a new light \\nverification  the final step of the scientific process is verification  this step\\nis distinct from the replication performed by the original observer  verifica\\ntion means that the observation is sufficiently robust that it will be repro\\nduced by any competent scientist who precisely follows the protocols of the\\noriginal observer  successful verification generally means that the observa\\ntion is accepted as fact  however  not all observations can be verified  some\\ntimes because of inaccuracies in the original report or insufficient replication \\nbut  failure  to  verify  usually  stems  from  the  fact  that  additional  variables \\nsuch as temperature or time of day  contributed to the original result  thus \\nthe process of verification  if affirmative  establishes new scientific fact  and \\nif negative  suggests new interpretations for the original observation \\noccasionally   one  reads  in  the  popular  press  about  a  case  of   scientific\\nfraud   researchers face keen competition for limited research funds and\\nfeel considerable pressure to  publish or perish   in the interest of expedi\\nency  a few have actually published  observations  that were never made \\nfortunately  such instances of fraud are rare  thanks to the scientific process \\nbefore long  other scientists find they are unable to verify the fraudulent\\nobservations and begin to question how they could have been obtained in\\nthe first place  the material you will learn in this book stands as a strong\\ntestament to the success of the scientific process \\nthe use of animals in neuroscience research\\nmost of what we know about the nervous system has come from experi\\nments on animals  in most cases  the animals are killed so their brains can\\nbe  examined  neuroanatomically   neurophysiologically   and or  neuro\\nchemically  the fact that animals are sacrificed for the pursuit of human\\nknowledge raises questions about the ethics of animal research \\nthe animals  let s begin by putting the issue in perspective  throughout\\nhistory  humans have considered animals and animal products as renew\\nable natural resources to be used for food  clothing  transportation  recre\\nation  sport  and companionship  the animals used for research  education \\nand testing have always been a small fraction of the total used for other\\npurposes  for example  in the united states  the number of animals used\\nfor all types of biomedical research is less than 1  of the number that\\nare  killed  for  food  alone 1  the  number  used  specifically  for  neuroscience\\nresearch is much smaller still  \\nneuroscience  experiments  are  conducted  using  many  different  species \\nranging from snails to monkeys  the choice of animal species is generally\\ndictated  by  the  question  under  investigation   the  level  of  analysis   and\\nthe  extent to which the knowledge gained at this level can be related to\\n16       c h a p t e r   1         neuroscience   past   present   and

such  as  the\\nsquid  on the other hand  understanding the neural basis of movement and\\nperceptual disorders in humans has required experiments on more closely\\nrelated species  such as the

developed world today  most educated adults have\\na concern for animal welfare  neuroscientists share this concern and work\\nto ensure that animals are well treated  it must also be appreciated  how\\never  that society has not always placed such value on animal welfare  as\\nreflected in some of the scientific practices of the past  for example  in his\\nexperiments early in the nineteenth century  magendie used unanesthetized\\npuppies  for which he was later criticized by his scientific rival bell   before\\npassing judgment  consider that the philosophy of descartes was very influ\\nential in french society at that time  animals of all types were believed to\\nbe  simple  automata   biological  machines  that  lacked  any  semblance  of\\nemotion  as disturbing as this now seems  it is also worth bearing in mind\\nthat humans scarcely had any more respect for one another than they did\\nfor  animals  during  this  period   slavery  was  still  practiced  in  the

representatives \\nafter passing the iacuc review  proposals are evaluated for scientific merit\\nby a panel of expert neuroscientists  this step ensures that only the most\\nworthwhile projects are carried out  then  when neuroscientists attempt to\\npublish their observations in the professional journals  the papers are care\\nfully reviewed by other neuroscientists for scientific merit and for animal\\nwelfare concerns  reservations about either issue can lead to rejection of\\nthe papers  which in turn can lead to a loss of funding for the research  in\\naddition to these monitoring

\\nneurogenetics \\nthe landscape of neurology has been transformed by modern molecular \\ngenetics  several hundred neurologic and psychiatric disorders can \\nnow be diagnosed through genetic testing  http   www ncbi nlm nih \\n gov sites genetests  db genetests   the vast majority of these represent \\nhighly penetrant mutations that cause rare neurologic disorders  \\nalternatively  they represent rare monogenic causes of common phenotypes  \\nexamples of the latter include mutations of the amyloid precursor \\nprotein in familial alzheimers disease  the microtubuleassociated \\nprotein tau  mapt  in frontotemporal dementia  and synuclein in \\nparkinsons disease  these discoveries have been profoundly important \\nbecause the mutated gene in the familial disorder often encodes a \\nprotein that is also pathogenetically involved  although not mutated  \\nin the typical  sporadic form  the common mechanism involves disordered \\nprocessing and  ultimately  aggregation of the protein leading to \\ncell death  see protein aggregation and neurodegeneration  below   \\nthere is optimism that complex genetic disorders  caused by combinations \\nof both genetic and environmental factors  have now become \\ntractable problems  genomewide association studies  gwas  have \\nbeen carried out in many complex neurologic disorders  with many \\nhundreds of variants identified  nearly all of which confer only a small \\nincrement in disease risk  1 15 to 1 5fold   gwas studies are rooted \\nin the common disease  common variant hypothesis  as they examine \\npotential risk alleles that are relatively frequent  e g   5   in the \\ngeneral population  more than 1500 gwas studies have been carried \\nout  with notable successes such as the identification of 110 risk alleles \\nfor multiple sclerosis  chap  458   furthermore  using bioinformatics \\ntools  risk variants can be aligned in functional biologic pathways to \\nidentify novel pathogenic mechanisms as well as to reveal heterogeneity \\n e g   different pathways in different individuals   despite these \\nsuccesses  many experienced geneticists question the real value of \\ncommon diseaseassociated variants  particularly whether they are \\nactually causative or merely mark the approximate locations of more \\nimportant truly causative rare mutations  \\nthis debate has set the stage for the next revolution in human genetics  \\nmade possible by the development of increasingly efficient and \\ncosteffective highthroughput sequencing methodologies  it is already \\npossible to sequence an entire human genome in approximately an \\nhour  at a cost of only  1300 for the entire coding sequence  wholeexome  \\nor  3000 for the entire genome  it is certain that these costs \\nwill continue to decline  this makes it feasible to look for diseasecausing \\nsequence variations in individual patients with the possibility \\nof identifying rare variants that cause disease  the utility of this \\napproach was demonstrated by wholegenome sequencing in a patient \\nwith charcot marie tooth neuropathy  in which compound heterozygous \\nmutations were identified in the sh3tc2 gene  which then were \\nshown to cosegregate with the disease in other members of the family  \\nit is increasingly recognized that not all genetic diseases or predispositions \\nare caused by simple changes in the linear nucleotide sequence \\nof genes  diseasecausative mutations also occur commonly in \\nnoncoding sequences of dna  for example  large intronic ggggcc \\nrepeat expansions in a gene of unknown function c9orf 72  chromosome \\n9 open reading frame 72  were recently identified as a common \\ncause of both frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis \\n als   this mutation is the most common cause of both familial \\nand sporadic als identified thus far  it was shown to be associated \\nwith tdp43  tar dna binding protein43  inclusions in both hippocampal

tissue of \\naffected patients  three potential pathogenic mechanisms have been \\nproposed  including  1  haploinsufficiency   2  repeat rnamediated \\ntoxicity  and  3  dipeptide protein toxicity  the possibility of rna \\ntoxicity is supported by the finding of intranuclear rna foci containing \\nc9orf 72 hexanucleotide repeats and specific rnabinding \\nproteins  the c9orf 72 mrna forms quadruplexes of dna and rna  \\nwhich then can halt transcription and also bind transcription factors  \\nmutations in both tardp  transactive region dna binding protein  \\nand fus  fused in sarcoma

understanding of the \\nrole of copy number variation in human disease is still in its infancy  \\nthe role of splicing variation as a contributor to neurologic disease \\nis another area of active investigation  alternative splicing refers to the \\ninclusion of different combinations of exons in mature mrna  resulting \\nin the potential for many different protein products encoded by a \\nsingle gene  alternative splicing represents a powerful mechanism for \\ngeneration of complexity and variation  and this mechanism appears to \\nbe highly prevalent in the nervous system  affecting key processes such \\nas neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels  numerous diseases \\nare already known to result from abnormalities in alternative splicing  \\nincreased inclusion of

instead  depending on the presence of cognitive \\nimpairment  they can be described as focal seizures with or without \\ndyscognitive features  focal seizures can also evolve into generalized \\nseizures  in the past this was referred to as focal seizures with secondary \\ngeneralization  but the new system relies on specific descriptions of the \\ntype of generalized seizures that evolve

\\nthe seizure may be nonlocalizing  however  the seizure focus is often \\ndetected using sphenoidal or surgically placed intracranial electrodes  \\nfocal seizures without dyscognitive features focal seizures can cause \\nmotor  sensory  autonomic  or psychic symptoms without impairment \\nof cognition  for example  a patient having a focal motor seizure arising \\nfrom the right primary

\\nflexion extension movements  at a frequency of  2 3 hz  pure \\ntonic posturing may be seen as well  since the cortical region controlling \\nhand movement is immediately adjacent to the region for

ictal eeg  may show \\nabnormal discharges in a very limited region over the appropriate area \\nof cerebral cortex if the seizure focus involves the cerebral convexity  \\nseizure activity occurring within deeper brain structures is sometimes \\nnot detected by the standard eeg  however  and may require intracranial \\nelectrodes for its detection  \\nthree additional features of focal motor seizures are worth noting  \\nfirst  in some patients  the abnormal motor movements may begin \\nin a very restricted region such as the fingers and gradually progress \\n over seconds to minutes  to include a larger portion of the extremity  \\nthis phenomenon  described by hughlings jackson and known \\nas a jacksonian march  represents the spread of seizure activity \\nover a progressively
